### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student that once tried programming and have never stopped learning since then. Being in awe of exploring new horizons, I keep learning. The path that I've been following so far has led me through countless challenges that in combination with my experience reflected in my projects, you can take a glance on right below. They'll explain more than I've ever could say.

But programming isn't the only activity I do. I'm also pleased by reading books (apart from documentation and programming related works). Another thing is design, graphical design in particular, I've designed all my websites and some other projects as well as preserved a bunch of layouts the most of which the world hasn't even seen. Recently I've taken on a new hobby - blogging that I really like doing as it's a great way to share your experience, thoughts and more important structure your knowledge. As the saying goes:

> Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.
